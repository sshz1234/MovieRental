In this program, we have 3 different pages. They are linked in the main page. The first is to sign up users, as well as see other users. This will include your email, your name, as well as your phone number. The second will include movies that can be added and critiqued, as well as can have its duration time described in minutes. The final page which is the rental page can allow the user to rent the movies from the signing up and from the movies critiqued from others, and can allow people to sign them out from a starting to an ending date, as well as put a price point on how expensive it will come out to be.The links on the home page leading to the Renters, Rental Movies, and Rental Movies do not work on azure, but will work locally.Another thing is that for the bonus I have added Different formatting for the names above the titles of each of the tables using [Display(Name="")], which allowed me to name my table from the models. Here is my Azure Web App link:
